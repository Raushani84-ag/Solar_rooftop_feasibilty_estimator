# ‚òÄÔ∏è Solar Feasibility Calculator

A simple and intuitive web application to calculate the feasibility and payback period of installing solar panels on your roof. Built with Python and Streamlit.

## üéØ Features

- **System Sizing**: Calculate optimal solar system size based on available roof area
- **Financial Analysis**: Determine payback period and monthly savings
- **Energy Generation**: Estimate monthly electricity generation
- **Cost Analysis**: Calculate total system installation cost
- **Interactive UI**: Clean and user-friendly interface with real-time calculations
- **Smart Insights**: Coverage percentage and excess generation analysis

## üîß Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Python
- **Frontend**: Streamlit
- **Libraries**: Built-in Python libraries only 

## üìã Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

## üîç How It Works

### Input Parameters

1. **System Parameters**
   - **Roof Area**: Available roof space for solar panel installation (sq meters)
   - **Monthly Consumption**: Your average monthly electricity usage (kWh)

2. **Financial Parameters**
   - **Tariff Rate**: Current electricity cost per unit (‚Çπ/kWh)
   - **System Cost**: Solar installation cost per watt (‚Çπ/Watt)

3. **Environmental Parameter**
   - **Solar Irradiance**: Average daily solar irradiance in your location (kWh/m¬≤/day)

### Calculations

- **System Size**: Based on roof area and panel efficiency (10%)
- **Monthly Generation**: System size √ó irradiance √ó 30 days √ó performance ratio (75%)
- **Monthly Savings**: Monthly consumption √ó tariff rate
- **Total Cost**: System size √ó cost per watt √ó 1000
- **Payback Period**: Total cost √∑ annual savings

## üí° Usage Example

```python
from solar_backend.calculator import SolarCalculator

# Create calculator instance
calculator = SolarCalculator(
    roof_area_sqm=100,
    monthly_electricity_consumption_kwh=300,
    tariff_rate=5.0,
    cost_per_watt=50,
    irradiance=5.0
)

# Get results
results = calculator.get_summary()
print(results)
```

## üìä Sample Output

```
System Size: 10.0 kW
Monthly Generation: 1125.0 kWh
Monthly Savings: ‚Çπ1,500.00
Total Cost: ‚Çπ5,00,000.00
Payback Period: 27.8 years
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The calculator uses the following default assumptions:
- **Panel Efficiency**: 10% (real-world average)
- **Performance Ratio**: 75% (accounts for system losses)
- **Days per Month**: 30 (for calculation purposes)

## üéØ Key Insights

- **Payback Analysis**:
  - ‚â§ 5 years: Excellent investment
  - 5-8 years: Good investment
  - > 8 years: Consider carefully

- **Coverage Analysis**:
  - Shows percentage of electricity needs covered
  - Highlights excess generation potential
  - Calculates remaining grid dependency

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

- [ ] Add battery storage calculations
- [ ] Include government subsidy calculations
- [ ] Add seasonal variation analysis
- [ ] Export results to PDF
- [ ] Add location-based solar irradiance database
- [ ] Include maintenance cost projections
- [ ] Add financing options calculator
